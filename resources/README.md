# Resources

Reusable templates, guides, and references for the System of Intent.

## What Qualifies as a Resource?

A **Resource** is:
- Reusable across multiple sessions/contexts
- Complex enough to prevent mistakes if forgotten
- Stable (doesn't change every session)
- Provides ACTUAL value (not Documentation Theater)

## Contents

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| AGENT_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md | Checklist for sub-agent prompt preparation |
| COMPACT_TEMPLATE.md | Instructions for session continuity after /compact |

## Anti-Pattern Warning

See `.memory/CONTEXT.md` for the **Documentation Theater** anti-pattern. Resources here have been validated as providing genuine value beyond what would be naturally written.
